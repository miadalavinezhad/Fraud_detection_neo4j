# Nosql database project (Neo4j graph database)
In this project datasets with different sizes are created and uploaded into the Neo4j database. The goal is to design a data model for the database, write and execute the queries for the given operations and record the performances. The data model and queries are design in the way to get the best performance out both in time and space complexity.
The data for this project is made using the dataset_creation in CSV format. By adjusting few variables in the code, the number of records created by it can be tuned.
Uploading and executing queries on the database is done through python driver. The driver connects to the DB locally(or on cloud depending on where you want to have your DB to be set) and execute the queries.
